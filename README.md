# LEARNING-DSA
Started learning DSA on 9th June 2025. I will be consistent this time.

---
## Day 1
- Learn about basic cpp syntax, 
- hello World print
- Data types (int, long, long long, float, double, char, string )
- `getline()` is used to take the hole string
- `One(1) byte = Eight(8) bits`

### Data  Types cheatsheet

## Day 2 (11th June 2025)

### To-do
- Array
- Strings
- Practice some questions

### Array:
- Array are used to store multiples values in a single variable, instead of declearing seperate variables for each vlue
- Example `int num[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Array is based on `zero` based index
- in cpp array are passed as pass by reeference.

### Strings
- Strings also stores the characters in terms of a index.
- `string name = "Anirban"`.
- position of `A` is `zero`.
- `name.size()` to find length of a `string` 
- Learn about strings and array in cpp.
- Array operation and string operations.

### Time complexity
- The time taken is not = time complexity
- Time complexity != time taken
- Time taken is = time conplexity? `Explain`
- Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.
- There are 3 cases `best`, `average` and `worst` case.
- Denoted as `Big-oh(O)`.
- Big-oh(O) - Wors-case - Upper-Bound
- Theta() - Average Case
- Omega() - Lowest bound

#### Rules to calculate time conplexity
- Calculate in term of `worst` case. case scenario. `Why?` find out it.
- Avoid contants. 
- Avoid lower value.
